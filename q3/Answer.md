a) The shape is a spherical cloud centred around imaginary value = 0 and is also mirrored across x-axis.

b) As D grows, the cloud of eigenvalues gets increasingly spread out and moved along the real
axis away from the origin towards the negative direction. The general shape along the imaginary axis remains the same.
In fact, the center of the cloud is at 0 imaginary, -D real.
c) If the matrix is real and symmetric, the eigenvalues will be real integers, and the plot will display them along the
real axis rather than all across the complex plane.

### Bonus

If the random components of the matrix are correlated, it will have an influence on the distribution of the
eigenvalues, but the precise effect will depend on the correlation structure. In general, a change in the correlation
structure of the matrix's components may result in a shift in the eigenvalues' distribution. For most correlations it
will just stay an elliptical cloud .

In case of the example mentioned of skew-symmetric we see that get more concentrated along the real axis almost forming
an X shape centered at Real = 0 since the diagonal entries have to be 0 for this.
