a) The shape is a cloud centred around imaginary value = 0 and is also mirrored across x-axis.

b) As D grows, the cloud of eigenvalues gets increasingly spread out and moved along the real
axis away from the origin towards the negative direction. The general shape along the imaginary axis remains the same.

c) If the matrix is real and symmetric, the eigenvalues will be real integers, and the plot will display them along the
real axis rather than all across the complex plane.

### Bonus

If the random components of the matrix are correlated, it will have an influence on the distribution of the
eigenvalues, but the precise effect will depend on the correlation structure. In general, a change in the correlation
structure of the matrix's components may result in a shift in the eigenvalues' distribution.

In case of the example mentioned we see that get more concentrated along the real axis and as D increases, this
concentration reaches a level where it almost appears as a straight vertical line parallel to imaginary axis.
