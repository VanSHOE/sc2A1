Setting up the Ax = b equation we get:

`A = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, -1, 0, 0], [1, 0, -1, 0], [1, 0, 0, -1], [0, 1, -1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 1, -1]]`

`x = [x1, x2, x3, x4]`

`b = [2.95, 1.74, -1.45, 1.32, 1.23, 4.45, 1.61, 3.21, 0.45, -2.75]`

The linear square solution is almost same as the direct measurements.

`2.95 <-> 2.96`
Absolute Difference of 0.01

`1.74 <-> 1.746`
Absolute Difference of 0.006

`-1.45 <-> -1.46`
Absolute Difference of 0.01

`1.32 <-> 1.314`
Absolute Difference of 0.006

As we can see there is only a max error of 0.01 in the linear square solution.
